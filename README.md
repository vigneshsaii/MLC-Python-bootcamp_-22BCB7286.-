import random
-->This line imports the random module, which is used later to select a random greeting response.




def greet():
    print("Hello! I'm your chatbot. How can I help you today?")
-->Defines a function greet() that prints a welcome message when called.




def farewell():
    print("Goodbye! Have a great day.")
-->Defines a function farewell() that prints a goodbye message when called.




def respond_to_greeting():
    responses = ["Hi there!", "Hello!", "Hey!", "Greetings!"]
    print(random.choice(responses))
-->Defines a function respond_to_greeting() that randomly selects and prints a greeting response from the list.




def handle_user_input(user_input):
    if "how are you" in user_input.lower():
        print("I'm just a computer program, but I'm doing well! Thanks for asking.")
    elif "bye" in user_input.lower() or "goodbye" in user_input.lower():
        farewell()
    else:
        print("I'm not sure how to respond to that. Can you ask me something else?")
-->Defines a function handle_user_input(user_input) that checks the user's input and responds accordingly. If the input contains "how are you," it responds with a specific message. If the input contains "bye" or "goodbye," it calls the farewell() function. Otherwise, it prints a generic response.




def main():
    greet()
    
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        
        if user_input.lower() == "exit":
            farewell()
            break

        respond_to_greeting()
        handle_user_input(user_input)
-->Defines the main function main(). It calls the greet() function to welcome the user. Then, it enters a loop where it continuously prompts the user for input. If the user inputs "exit," it calls the farewell() function and breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it calls the respond_to_greeting() and handle_user_input() functions to handle the user's input.




if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
-->This block ensures that the main() function is executed only if the script is run as the main program (not imported as a module). It's a common Python idiom to organize code that can be both reusable as a module and executable as a standalone program.
